    quick to reply, and always reliable showed up to my door right on time and always brought me back within 
    the hour. We focused on the routes they are likely to test you on which made me feel confident and comfortable 
    during the test. I've become a confident driver thanks to Ismail and I passed first try! Forget Young 
    Drivers or other large companies, trust Ismail to take care of you.`,

    reviewText: `I had an awesome driving experience with Ismail. I was extremely anxious when 
      I first started driving and my confidence was very low. Ismail helped me firstly to 
      get more confident with driving and lower my anxiety then we started the learning for the road test. 
      I had my learner's license over a year never tried to learn because I was so anxious. 
      I started driving with Ismail around July of this year and took my test in November and passed on my first try. 
      I highly recommend Ismail to every new driver. He is very good, stays calm knowledgeable, friendly and 
      encourage people to drive safely and not just to pass the road test. 
      He is amazing instructor. Thank you Ismail!`,

    reviewText: `Ismail made what I thought would be a stressful journey feel completely manageable. 
    His teaching style is clear and intuitive, breaking down complex traffic situations into simple, 
    easy-to-follow steps. I never felt overwhelmed, even during busy rush hour drives. He has a natural way of 
    putting students at ease while still holding them to a high standard. I now drive with awareness and control 
    I didn't think I'd achieve so quickly.`,
